# Individual Contributors

These titles describe seniority along four main axes: domain knowledge and execution, teaching and mentoring, culture and leadership, and customer success.

In addition to titles, roles serve to recognize contributions to the team in sub sets of the four main axes. The Lead role identifies engineers with strong capabilities in teaching and mentorship, and culture and leadership, while the architect role identifies engineers with strong capabilities in domain knowledge and technical execution.

All subsequent titles assume all previous requirements. All titles and roles are expected to keep customer success in mind.
